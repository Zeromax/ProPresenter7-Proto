# ProPresenter7-Proto

ProPresenter 7 uses Google Protocol Buffers to store document and various configuration files.  
See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers

This is a set of ***unsupported, reverse-engineered*** .proto files that define the messages (data structures) used in the ProPresenter 7 files that are stored as Google Protocol Buffers.


Using these .proto files it is possible to create code to read, create and modify ProPresenter 7 data files including:
  * Documents
  * PlayLists
  * (TODO: all other protobuf definitions like workspace, stage, CCLI etc etc)
