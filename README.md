# ProPresenter7-Proto

ProPresenter 7 uses Google Protocol Buffers to store document and various configuration files.
This is a set of *unsupported, reverse-engineered* .proto files that define the messages (data structures) used in the ProPresenter 7 files that are stored as Google Protocol Buffers.

Including:
  * Documents
  * PlayLists
  * (TODO: all other protobuf definitions)
